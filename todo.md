- [ ] **Header Redesign**
    - [ ] Add Top Bar (black/dark grey) with phone number, email, and "Track Order" link.
    - [ ] Move Search Bar to the center of the main header and make it large/prominent with a "Hľadať" button.
    - [ ] Reorganize navigation to be secondary or part of a "Categories" dropdown if needed, or keep it clean but less dominant than search.
- [ ] **Hero Section Overhaul**
    - [ ] Change layout to feature a specific "Hero Product" (e.g., a flagship phone).
    - [ ] Add technical specs badges/list overlay on the hero (e.g., "Snapdragon 8 Gen 2", "120Hz OLED").
    - [ ] Add a prominent price tag and "Buy Now" button directly in the hero.
- [ ] **Trust Indicators (Benefits Bar)**
    - [ ] Create a new section immediately below the Hero.
    - [ ] Add icons + text: "Doprava do 24h", "Autorizovaný servis", "Vrátenie do 14 dní", "Odborné poradenstvo".
- [ ] **UI "Tech" Sharpening**
    - [ ] Reduce `rounded-2xl` and `rounded-3xl` to `rounded-md` or `rounded-sm` in `index.css` and components.
    - [ ] Increase contrast on buttons (maybe use a tech blue or keep the green but make it punchier).
    - [ ] Ensure fonts and spacing feel denser and more information-rich, typical of tech specs.
- [ ] **Update Hero to iPhone 17 Pro (2026 Context)**
    - [ ] Generate a new high-quality Hero image featuring a futuristic "iPhone 17 Pro" design (sleek, titanium/glass, premium look).
    - [ ] Update `Home.tsx` text:
        - [ ] Change "iPhone 15 Pro" to "iPhone 17 Pro".
        - [ ] Update specs: "A17 Pro" -> "A19 Bionic" (or similar futuristic name), "48MPx" -> "200MPx" or "Fusion Camera", etc.
        - [ ] Update price to reflect a new flagship (maybe slightly higher or similar).
    - [ ] Ensure the new image fits the "Nordic Air" / "Tech" aesthetic (clean background, sharp details).
- [ ] **Header Logo Optimization**
    - [ ] Remove the text "HDMOBIL" from the header (next to the logo image).
    - [ ] Increase the size of the logo image (`img`) significantly.
    - [ ] Ensure the logo container has a fixed height or constraints so it doesn't expand the parent header bar height.
- [ ] **Initial Loading Screen (Preloader)**
    - [ ] Create a `Preloader` component that overlays the entire screen.
    - [ ] Implement logic to preload critical images (Hero image, Category icons, Logo) before hiding the preloader.
    - [ ] Add a smooth fade-out animation when loading is complete.
    - [ ] Show a pulsing logo or progress indicator during loading.
- [ ] **Mega Menu Implementation**
    - [ ] Define subcategories structure for each main category (Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops, Audio, Accessories, Spare Parts).
    - [ ] Create a `MegaMenu` component or update `Layout` navigation to support dropdowns on hover.
    - [ ] Style the dropdowns to match the "Nordic Tech" aesthetic (clean, organized, shadow).
    - [ ] Ensure hover interaction is smooth and doesn't disappear too easily (use a slight delay or safe area).
- [ ] **Logo Transparency**
    - [ ] Process `/images/logo_nordic.png` to remove the white background and save as `/images/logo_nordic_transparent.png`.
    - [ ] Update `Layout.tsx` to use the new transparent logo.
    - [ ] Update `Preloader.tsx` to use the new transparent logo.
- [ ] **Mobile Menu Refactor**
    - [ ] Replace the static list of subcategories in the mobile menu with an accordion/collapsible component.
    - [ ] Use `Collapsible` from shadcn/ui or create a custom state-based toggle.
    - [ ] Add a chevron icon that rotates when the category is expanded.
    - [ ] Ensure only the main category link is clickable for navigation, while the expand button toggles the sub-menu.
- [ ] **New Logo Generation**
    - [ ] Extract primary green color from `index.css`.
    - [ ] Create a Python script using PIL/Pillow to draw the new logo:
        - [ ] "HD" in a solid green box (white text).
        - [ ] "MOBIL" in a black outlined box (black text).
        - [ ] Add the decorative brackets/accents.
        - [ ] Save as `/images/logo_new.png`.
    - [ ] Update `Layout.tsx` and `Preloader.tsx` to use `/images/logo_new.png`.
- [ ] **Logo Component Implementation**
    - [ ] Create `client/src/components/Logo.tsx`.
    - [ ] Implement the logo using HTML/CSS with `skew-x` transforms to match the reference.
    - [ ] Use the primary green color for the "HD" box and dark color for "MOBIL".
    - [ ] Add the decorative brackets using pseudo-elements or absolute positioning.
    - [ ] Replace the `img` tag in `Layout.tsx` and `Preloader.tsx` with the `<Logo />` component.
